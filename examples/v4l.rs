    // a zero-copy operation.

    // To achieve the best possible performance, you may want to use a
    // UserBufferStream instance, but this is not supported on all devices,
    // so we stick to the mapped case for this example.
    // Please refer to the rustdoc docs for a more detailed explanation about
    // buffer transfers.

    // the stream. Once an error condition occurs, the iterator will return

        // To process the captured data, you can pass it somewhere else.
        // If you want to modify the data or extend its lifetime, you have to
        // copy it. This is a best-effort tradeoff solution that allows for
        // zero-copy readers while enforcing a full clone of the data for
        // writers.
